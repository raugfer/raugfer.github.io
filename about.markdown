I am software engineer with broad experience in developing system and embedded software, full-stack and mobile applications.

I am in constant search of simplicity, performance and integrity when conceiving computational systems.

I formally studied Computer Science:

* I have a Ph.D. degree from [Yale University](https://cpsc.yale.edu/) (2010). I became a researcher and expert in Formal Semantics and Program Verification.
* I have a M.Sc. degree from [Unicamp](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/) (2001). I wrote a complete implementation of the JVM, including AOT/JIT compiler and system runtime; it was called [JewelVM](https://github.com/jewelvm).
* I have a B.Sc. degree from [UFMG](https://www.dcc.ufmg.br/) (1998). I acquired a strong systems background and had lots of fun writing program in C, C++, Pascal, assembly and others.

I would like to grown my career as an open-software developer:

* [Cashu](https://cachu.cc/) is a non-custodial mobile crypto wallet.
* [crypto-java](https://github.com/raugfer/crypto-java) is a crypto primitives library written from scratch and supporting the most popular cryptocurrencies.

I am a decentralization advocate and blockchain enthusiast.

I know the internals of [Bitcoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/).

I love compilers and code optimization.

I have plenty of ideas to improve programming languages and tools.

I have written a couple of [published papers](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=IIpRq38AAAAJ).

I have received multiple scholarships.

I have once won 2 out of 3 prizes in a hackathon.

I have written compiler code for a large graphics card manufacturer.

I have written a commercial grade hotel booking system.

I write mostly [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programs.

I code with [gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit) and a [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) console.

I know how to write certified code and prove program properties using [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).

I usually remove comments and style other people's code before I read.

I demand the use of type systems in programming.

I spend more time naming and organizing things rather than implementing them.

I believe at least 20% of the time should be devoted to refactoring.

I document for my older self, to read in 5 years.

I do not allocate all my working hours to others.

I lived abroad for more than 7 years.

I start phrases with I... Apparently!
