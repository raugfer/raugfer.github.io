I am software engineer with broad experience in developing embedded and system software, full-stack and mobile applications.

I am inconstant search of simplicity, performance and integrity when conceiving computational systems.

I formally studied Computer Science:

* I have a Ph.D. degree from Yale University (2010). I became a researcher an expert in Formal Semantics and Program Verification.
* I have a M.Sc. degree from Unicamp (2001). I wrote a complete implementation of the JVM, including AOT/JIT compiler and system runtime.
* I have a B.Sc. degree from UFMG (1998). I acquired a strong systems background and had lots of fun writting program in C, C++, Pascal, assembly and others.

I would like to grown my carreer as an open-software developer.

* [Cashu](https://cachu.cc/) is a non-custodial mobile crypto wallet.
* [crypto-java](https://github.com/raugfer/crypto-java) is a crypto primitives library written from scratch and supporting the most popular cryptocurrencies.

I am a decentralization advocate and blockchain enthusiast.

I love compilers and code optimization.

I have plenty of ideas to improve programming languages and tools.

I demand the use of type systems in programming.

I have received multiple scholarships.

I have written a couple of [published papers](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=IIpRq38AAAAJ).

I have once won two out of three prizes in a hackathon.

I code with gedit and a bash console.

I write mostly [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programs, at the moment.

I usually remove comments and style other people's code before I read.

I spend more time naming and organizing things rather than implementing then.

I believe at least 20% of the time should be devoted to refactoring.

I document for my older self, to read in five years.

I do not allocate all my working hours to others.

I start phrases with I.
