I am software engineer with broad experience in developing embedded and system software, full-stack and mobile applications.

I am inconstant search of simplicity, performance and integrity when conceiving computational systems.

I am a decentralization advocate and blockchain enthusiast.

I love compilers and code optimization.

I have plenty of ideas to improve programming languages and tools.

I demand the use of type systems in programming.

I would like to grown my carreer as an open-software developer.

* Cashu is a non-custodial mobile crypto wallet.
* crypto-java is a crypto primitives library written from scratch and supporting the most popular cryptocurrencies.

I formally studied Computer Science:

* I have a Ph.D. degree from Yale University (2010). I became a researcher an expert in Formal Semantics and Program Verification.
* I have a M.Sc. degree from Unicamp (2001). I wrote a complete implementation of a JVM including AOT/JIT compiler and system runtime.
* I have a B.Sc. degree from UFMG (1998). I acquired a strong systems background and had lots of fun writting program in C, C++, Pascal, and others.

I have received multiple scholarships.

I have won two out of three prizes in a hackathon.

I code with gedit and a bash console.

I usually remove comments and style other people's code before I read.

I spend more time naming and organizing things rather than implementing then.

I believe 20% of the time coding should be devoted to refactoring.

I do not allocate all my working hours to others.
